# BasicCounterComposeSample
This is a simple counter implemented with JetPack Compose. 

It has a composable with a number and two buttons.
One button increases the number by one.
The other button decreases the number by 1(number never goes below zero).

This is a sample to demonstrate how variables that hold values shown in a compose interface should be hoisted out of composable function. 

In this sample, the viewmodel is responsible for holding the value of the counter as well as increasing and decreasing its value.
